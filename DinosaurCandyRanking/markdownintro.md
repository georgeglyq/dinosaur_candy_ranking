## Project Overview
In this project we will be producing data in regard to the best candy of a category
(such as chocolate or nut based), suggested candies that are similar to a user preference,
and their contents. Our purpose is to inform consumers about what is the best candy for
themselves or their kids in terms of flavor and nutritional facts. It will also be useful
to prospective candy makers which are looking to make the best tasting candies based on
current preferences. This is important because it might save someone an extra trip to the
store because a candy isn't good or is too unhealthy. Market research and learning consumer
preferences is also very important for a product to be successful.

## Audience
Our audience will be people who are looking to buy candies for themselves or their children
that would like to pick the best tasting candy or are looking for healthier alternatives.
We are targeting companies who are looking to make candies for the public and need information
about consumer preferences.

## Data
The data we will be using is the Candy Power Ranking dataset which is from the FiveThirtyEight
blog. This data was collected through voting of 269,000 randomly generated candy combinations and
86 samples which have specific information including things like ingredients, cost, and sugar
content. This data is publicly available [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/candy-power-ranking)

## Questions
Test categories include the following:
* What is considered the best category in its class? (peanut, chocolate, fruit, etc.)
* What candy would an individual like given their current preference?
* What are the nutritional facts for a certain candy?"
